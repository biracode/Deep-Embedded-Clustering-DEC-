# Deep-Embedded-Clustering-DEC-
 - Implementation of DEC and IDEC (improved-DEC) on mnist dataset, based on the original public code.

The method discovers a latent representation of data points and then make cluster in this embedded space.

- Pre-training weights are available in the repository.

- Hyperparameters are chosen according to the original paper.

- At the end of the code there is an implementation of classical methods for clustering.
